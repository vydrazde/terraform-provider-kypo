## Schema

### Required

- `pool_id` (Number) Id of associated sandbox pool

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `warning_on_allocation_failure` (Boolean) If `true`, will emit a warning instead of error when one of the allocation request stages fails.

### Read-Only

- `allocation_request` (Attributes) Associated allocation request (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--allocation_request))
- `cleanup_request` (Attributes) Associated cleanup request (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cleanup_request))
- `created_by` (Attributes) Creator of this sandbox pool (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--created_by))
- `id` (Number) Sandbox Allocation Unit Id

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
